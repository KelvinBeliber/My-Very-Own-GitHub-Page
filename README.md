# KEY TAKEAWAYS

The exercise helped me understand the importance of responsive design, which uses CSS media queries and viewport meta tags to adjust smoothly
to different screen sizes. Layout design was made simpler using CSS flexbox, and visual appeal was improved with features like box-shadow and
border-radius. In addition to backdrop pictures and hover effects for interactivity, semantic HTML tags and informative comments made the code
easier to comprehend. Creating a Â footer with copyright and contact information enhanced credibility, while keeping font styling constant 
guaranteed readability and appeal. This experience made it clear how crucial it is to keep learning new things to improve web development abilities
and stay up to date with the latest trends.
